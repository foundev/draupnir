# Asgard 3/4 results

Status: the 40-call Q3 captured-context replay, 20-run initial pilot, 45-run
corrected-bootstrap replication, 38-run Q4 policy comparison, and 12-study Q4
shadow calibration are complete. Q3 compression, Q4 explicit-probe rollout, and
the true survivor tournament are all **no-go**.

## Direct verdicts

- Stateful/delta supervision has a large structural opportunity, but none of the four
  compact representations met the combined protected-endpoint, protected-live-result,
  and cache-economics gates. Keep `full` as the default.
- Explicit probe policy changed the candidate/depth distribution, but did not save
  cost. In the authoritative clean pair it increased total raw input 3.0%; across all
  38 valid runs it increased total raw input 1.1%. Only 15/389 explicit windows
  (3.9%) were probes. Do not promote Prototype A.
- A true survivor tournament is not justified. Prototype B retained the eventual
  winner after two probe steps in only 7/12 valid live studies (58.3%). Five late
  bloomers were killed; even eight perfect remaining studies could reach only 75%,
  so the pre-registered 90% gate failed by mathematical futility.
- `recent-exact-tail` had the best live score (3/4), but it lost the protected Returns
  solution, failed the replay endpoint gate, and raised uncached input per routing
  window by 18.4%. It is an interesting baseline, not a production candidate.
- `checkpoint-plus-delta` was the strongest structured mode (2/4) and almost held
  uncached input per window flat (+0.6%), but it also lost protected Returns and failed
  the replay endpoint gate. The frozen-checkpoint hypothesis is not supported strongly
  enough to promote.
- Correcting the compact bootstrap did not rescue Q3. Across 15 runs per mode, `full`
  scored 9/15, checkpoint 7/15, and recent-tail 6/15. On protected Returns the rates
  were 3/5, 1/5, and 1/5 respectively. Checkpoint raised total raw input per run 3.2%;
  recent-tail was effectively flat (+0.08%) while raising uncached input 21.2%.

## Facts

### Existing 40-run v9 cohort

The committed research brief reports that v9 reduced total raw tokens by 24.5% and
candidate tool-loop raw tokens by 31.9% versus v6, while the mixed non-candidate
residual rose 14.9%. Both cohorts succeeded on 9/40 runs, with only three common
successes and six flips in each direction. These totals motivate compression but do
not isolate supervisor usage.

Retrospective parsing of the same 40 v9 archives found 861 ordinary supervisor dossier
assemblies. Across the logged variable dossier components:

- selected initial history: 23,092,560 bytes (33.5%);
- accumulated selected windows: 29,631,176 bytes (43.0%);
- current candidates: 16,146,950 bytes (23.4%);
- old selected trajectory total: 76.6% of variable bytes.

The historical fraction rises from 37.7% at window 1 to 90.2% after window 20. This
is an impossible removal ceiling, not a savings estimate: it excludes the fixed
system/task/checklist/tool schema, audit-turn additions, compact replacement state,
output, and provider cache pricing.

### Eight-archive reproducible corpus

`extract_archive_corpus.py` processed all eight cases in
`scripts/asgard_live_regressions.json`:

- 110 ordinary dossier telemetry windows;
- 19 windows with aligned structured ordinary decisions;
- 91 older telemetry-only windows, retained with `decision_missing`;
- 8,165,022 measured component bytes;
- 4,834,357 bytes (59.21%) in selected initial plus selected windows;
- 3,191,010 bytes (39.08%) in accumulated selected windows alone;
- 3,330,665 bytes in current candidates.

All 19 aligned decisions used three lanes. Seventeen expose a next-window step count:
one chose 3 steps, ten chose 5, three chose 6, two chose 7, and one chose 8. This
sample shows neither spontaneous one-lane routing nor 1-2-step probes.

### Replayability gap

Old v9 archives trace candidate requests/responses and final structured supervisor
decisions, but not the supervisor's exact requests, audit exchanges, responses, or
per-call usage. Therefore old decisions cannot support faithful same-state replay.
The new opt-in capture records those missing fields for fresh runs.

### Protected-endpoint replay stop gate

The first fresh captured-context replay exercised window 14 of the successful
Returns control run, a protected endpoint at which the full supervisor selected
lane 0 and declared completion. All four compact prompts selected the same lane and
removed 44.4%--58.6% of rendered prompt bytes (35.7%--49.0% of raw input tokens),
but only `decision-log-only` reproduced the terminal decision. `latest-state`,
`checkpoint-plus-delta`, and `recent-exact-tail` instead funded one more lane for
two, two, and three steps respectively. Those three modes therefore scored 0% on
the required protected endpoint-agreement gate despite 100% winner agreement.

The pre-registered stop rule fired after four calls. The confirmatory result
therefore remains a stop/no-go. After an explicit later approval, the remaining
36 calls were run as exploratory follow-up rather than silently redefining the
gate. This is evidence that winner agreement alone is too weak for routing
compression: a false continuation changes cost and can expose a correct endpoint
to additional edits. Obligation preservation still requires manual review.

### Complete 40-call captured-context replay

The completed batch covers ten captured ordinary-routing states from PSD Tools
and Returns, with one call per state for each compact mode. It contains 40 unique
records: 21 direct selections and 19 fail-closed fallbacks where the compact
supervisor requested unavailable repository audit tools. All 21 direct selections
matched the full supervisor's winner, but only 7 matched the entire recorded
winner/completion/funding tuple. Nine direct selections flipped completion: eight
continued after the full control stopped and one stopped before the full control.

Treating every fallback as an execution of the captured full-control decision,
the mode-level results were:

| Mode | Fallback | Winner agreement | Winner + completion | Candidate-count agreement | Step agreement | Raw-input reduction |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| checkpoint + delta | 50% | 100% | 70% | 70% | 60% | 40.7% |
| decision log | 40% | 100% | 80% | 80% | 60% | 34.3% |
| latest state | 40% | 100% | 80% | 80% | 70% | 43.6% |
| recent exact tail | 60% | 100% | 80% | 70% | 70% | 34.6% |

Every mode failed the automated protected-decision gate: each reached only 80%
effective winner-plus-completion agreement across the five sampled decisions from
the protected Returns identity, versus the required 100%. No mode is
recommendation-ready, independent of the still-required human obligation review.
The complete machine-readable analysis, including disagreement and fallback rows
and usage vectors, is in `supervisor_replay_40_analysis.json`.

### Corrected-bootstrap live replication

The corrected replication closed the aggressive-bootstrap limitation in the first
pilot. Its authoritative clean cohort contains one run for each of three tasks and
three modes (nine runs total). All modes scored 2/3, but the identity of the failure
changed: `full` succeeded on protected Returns and Happy DOM but missed PSD, while
both compact modes succeeded on PSD and Happy DOM but missed protected Returns.
Equal aggregate score therefore concealed the exact protected regression the brief
forbids.

A controller-recovery race also yielded 36 additional valid, independent calls,
balanced at 12 per mode. They are labeled exploratory rather than silently folded
into the planned clean cohort. Across all 45 valid calls:

| Mode | Clean success | All success | Protected Returns | Prompt bytes removed | Total raw input/run | Uncached input/run |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| full | 2/3 | 9/15 | 3/5 | 0% | 11.735M | 1.050M |
| checkpoint + delta | 2/3 | 7/15 | 1/5 | 51.0% | 12.108M (+3.2%) | 1.157M (+10.2%) |
| recent exact tail | 2/3 | 6/15 | 1/5 | 50.8% | 11.745M (+0.08%) | 1.273M (+21.2%) |

Thus neither compact mode reduced actual aggregate raw cost after cache effects in
the larger balanced cohort. Both lost two of the three full-control Returns
successes, and both increased uncached input materially. The clean recent-tail run
did reduce total raw input 21.5%, but it also lost Returns; the larger cohort shows
that apparent saving was not stable. `corrected_bootstrap_clean_analysis.json` and
`corrected_bootstrap_all_analysis.json` preserve the full run-level records.

### Explicit-probe policy live comparison

The authoritative clean Q4 cohort contains one paired run on Returns, PSD, Happy
DOM, and Drizzle (eight runs total). Dynamic and explicit policy each scored 1/4,
but dynamic uniquely retained protected Returns while explicit uniquely gained
Drizzle. Explicit therefore failed the no-protected-regression rule despite equal
aggregate score.

| Clean mode | Success | Windows | Lane-steps | Probe windows | Total raw input/run | Candidate raw input/lane-step |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| dynamic | 1/4 | 94 | 743 | n/a | 16.020M | 74,595 |
| explicit probe | 1/4 | 104 | 745 | 4 | 16.493M (+3.0%) | 73,763 (-1.1%) |

The clean joint candidate/depth distributions had total-variation distance 0.384,
so the policy was behaviorally different by the pre-specified 5% tolerance. It was
not cheaper: mean lane-steps per window fell 9.4%, but more windows erased that
gain and total raw input rose.

The completed exploratory aggregate is balanced at 19 runs per mode. Dynamic
scored 6/19 and explicit 8/19; both retained 3/5 Returns, 2/5 PSD, and one Happy
success, while explicit gained two Drizzle successes versus none for dynamic.
That gain still did not buy savings:

| All-valid mode | Success | Windows | Lane-steps | Probe windows | Total raw input/run | Candidate raw input/lane-step |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| dynamic | 6/19 | 418 | 3,221 | n/a | 14.789M | 75,513 |
| explicit probe | 8/19 | 389 | 3,245 | 15 | 14.949M (+1.1%) | 76,256 (+1.0%) |

Only 15/389 explicit windows (3.9%) were actual probes; 374 were ordinary work.
Mean lane-steps per window increased 8.3% and the distribution distance remained
large at 0.270. Prototype A is therefore a real policy shift, not behaviorally the
same as dynamic windows, but it neither makes probes common nor reaches the required
10% candidate raw-token saving. `probe_policy_clean_analysis.json` and
`probe_policy_all_analysis.json` preserve the structured measurement.

## Implemented experiment controls

- `full` remains the byte-identical default control.
- `latest-state`, `checkpoint-plus-delta`, `decision-log-only`, and
  `recent-exact-tail` are research-only environment-selected modes.
- Compact modes make the next `state_summary` an explicitly cumulative replacement.
- Canonical execution evidence is mechanically rendered with its surrounding window,
  so repeated `L1` identifiers remain window-qualified in context.
- Checkpoint mode freezes both summary and ledger through a global checkpoint window;
  exact later selected windows are deltas. A unit test proves the checkpoint message
  is byte-identical between intervening windows.
- Every routing turn records chosen versus counterfactual full prompt bytes and token
  estimates. Opt-in capture records exact request/response/tool/usage data.
- Completion-review construction is not routed through the compression switch.
- A conservative serial fast path now provides the separately required compact,
  one-response selector with no audit catalog. It is opt-in, mechanically gated,
  cannot declare completion, traces every eligibility/fallback reason, and charges
  both calls when it falls back. It has no live eligibility or agreement observations
  yet and is not part of the Q3 pilot result above.
- Prototype B now has a strict shadow-study trace schema, executable recall scorer,
  and a research-only fixed core protocol: three lanes receive a forced one- or
  two-step probe, all three continue autonomously for five equal steps, and an
  opaque-label review chooses the endpoint before the first repository
  synchronization. Probe rankings classify architectural/contract versus cosmetic
  distinctions. Twelve live studies passed every protocol invariant; seven retained
  the final winner and five did not. The production/default tournament remains
  unchanged.

## Q4 shadow-survivor futility result

The first 12 two-step studies completed the decision-relevant shadow protocol before
their surrounding task runs were stopped. All 12 had exhaustive three-lane ground
truth, equal five-step continuations, isolated branches, blinded endpoint review,
complete usage accounting, and no scorer violation. Probe top-2 retained the blinded
final winner in 7/12 studies (58.3%; 95% Wilson interval 31.95%--80.67%). Among the
five rank-3 late bloomers, three probe distinctions were architectural/contractual or
mixed and two were cosmetic; failures were not confined to cosmetic implementation
progress.

At 12 studies, eight slots remained to the planned minimum of 20. Even if every one
were a hit, the maximum attainable rate was 15/20 (75%), below the fixed 90% gate.
Enrollment was therefore stopped for mathematical futility. The surrounding task
runs were cancelled after their complete shadow records were copied, so this early
cohort does not provide public grader outcomes; it does provide the exhaustive
counterfactual ranking needed for the tournament decision. The machine-readable
record is `shadow_survivor_futility_analysis.json`.

## Inferences

- Removing only accumulated selected windows understates the opportunity after generic
  candidate-history compaction, because old history moves into the larger
  `selected_initial` component. A replacement must address both components.
- `latest-state` removed 58.3% of rendered bytes but increased uncached input per
  routing window by 26.9%, confirming the cache-rewrite risk.
- `checkpoint-plus-delta` had the best compact-mode cache economics: 57.3% fewer
  rendered bytes and only 0.6% more uncached input per window. That efficiency did
  not rescue its protected-quality regression.
- `decision-log-only` is a useful lossy ablation, not the leading safety candidate:
  free-form historical state summaries are not mechanically complete.
- The recent-exact-tail baseline outscored every structured mode in this small live
  sample, so the experiment does not establish that structured state adds value over
  ordinary truncation.

## Live pilot facts

The completed pilot contains 20 runs, 456 byte-validated ordinary routing records,
and 961 ordinary supervisor model calls. Outcomes were deliberately kept paired by
task and mode:

| Task | full | latest | checkpoint | decision log | recent tail |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Returns | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| PSD Tools | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Happy DOM | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Drizzle | timeout | timeout | timeout | timeout | 1 |

Aggregate successes were 1/4 for `full`, 1/4 for `latest-state`, 2/4 for
`checkpoint-plus-delta`, 1/4 for `decision-log-only`, and 3/4 for
`recent-exact-tail`. These are single stochastic attempts, not success-rate estimates.
They show complementarity rather than monotone improvement: full uniquely retained
Returns, while compact modes gained PSD, Happy DOM, or Drizzle.

Measured ordinary-routing economics were:

| Mode | rendered bytes removed | estimated request tokens removed | raw input/window | uncached input/window | cache-read fraction |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| full | 0% | 0% | 57,955 | 12,053 | 79.2% |
| latest state | 58.3% | 55.4% | 52,704 | 15,300 | 71.0% |
| checkpoint + delta | 57.3% | 55.8% | 42,768 | 12,123 | 71.7% |
| decision log | 35.9% | 33.1% | 56,815 | 12,670 | 77.7% |
| recent exact tail | 59.1% | 58.2% | 45,384 | 14,266 | 68.6% |

All compact modes reduced raw input per routing window, but all also increased
uncached input per window because their cache-read fractions fell. The increase was
smallest for checkpoint (+0.6%), followed by decision log (+5.1%), recent tail
(+18.4%), and latest state (+26.9%). Aggregate total uncached input is additionally
confounded by different route lengths and the four Drizzle timeouts, so the
window-normalized comparison is the safer cache-economics read.

## Speculation to test

- Three-window checkpoints may be too frequent for short tasks and too infrequent for
  unusually large diffs. A byte threshold may outperform a fixed interval.
- Single-lane serial repair windows may support a compact selector with no advertised
  audit tools, but the current 19-decision archive sample contains no one-lane cases.
- Shallow probes may rank architectural investigations well but kill implementation
  lanes whose advantage appears only after compilation or integration testing.

## Experiment limitations

The first live pilot used one attempt per task/mode and cannot estimate variance.
Each live run used three DeepSeek V4 Flash candidate lanes and a DeepSeek V4 Pro
supervisor. Four first-pilot Drizzle modes timed out without a grader score; only
recent-tail finished Drizzle.

The pilot binary used an aggressive compact-mode bootstrap: before the first
cumulative state existed, compact modes omitted the exact selected-initial message.
That omission was found during replay validation and is corrected in source. The
45-run corrected-bootstrap replication above supersedes that limitation and still
fails the Q3 quality and cache-economics gates.

The clean Q3 and Q4 cohorts are the authoritative paired comparisons. A launcher
recovery race produced extra independent DeepSeek calls under duplicate run labels;
they are useful variance evidence but are labeled exploratory. Q4's final 19/19
aggregate is balanced by mode but differs by one task at the margins (dynamic has
one more Happy run; explicit has one more Drizzle run), which is another reason not
to use its aggregate success delta as a causal policy estimate.

Live Q3 tasks did not enable exact supervisor request/response capture, so their
phase-specific ordinary-routing usage is unavailable. Reported Q3 costs are actual
result-level totals after cache effects, while prompt reductions are deterministic
chosen-versus-full counterfactuals. Q4 candidate-window usage has complete structured
coverage. Analysis excluded 102 cancellation-only ZIPs and five infrastructure
markers; 83 archives contained both a result and Draupnir trace.

## Current recommendation

Promote no compact Q3 mode. Preserve the full control as default and retain the
capture/replay switches for research. The captured replay and corrected-bootstrap
live replication now independently fail the protected-quality gate, and the larger
live cohort shows no aggregate raw-cost saving for checkpoint or recent-tail.

Do not implement Prototype C or a production tournament: Prototype B failed its 90%
top-2 survivor-recall gate by mathematical futility. Do not promote Prototype A:
it changed behavior but made probes rare, cost slightly more in both the clean and
all-valid comparisons, and replaced a protected clean success with a different task.

The only unmeasured production possibility left on this branch is the conservative
single-lane serial fast path. It remains opt-in and unpromoted; it cannot overturn
the no-go for history compression or probe tournaments without its own eligibility,
fallback, agreement, and cache-economics cohort.

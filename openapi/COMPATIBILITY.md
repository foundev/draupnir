# Draupnir HTTP API compatibility policy

The files in this directory are the authoritative wire contract for the
Draupnir Agent API:

- `draupnir.v1.yaml` — OpenAPI 3.1 document for every `/v1` endpoint and
  `/health`.
- `draupnir.v1.events.schema.json` — JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) for the
  payload of every Server-Sent Event on `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}/events`.

The black-box conformance suite (`tests/http_conformance.rs`) starts a real
`draupnir serve` daemon and validates its responses and event stream against these
schemas; CI fails when the implementation and the contract drift. Draupnir does
not ship SDK packages or generator tooling. Consumers can use these versioned
contract files with the generator and language of their choice; the companion
event schema describes the JSON payloads carried by the SSE endpoint.

## Versioning

The contract carries a semantic version in `info.version`, independent of
the crate version. The URL prefix (`/v1`) is the major version.

## What may change within `/v1`

Backwards-compatible changes bump the contract's **minor** version:

- Adding new endpoints or new optional request parameters/fields.
- Adding new response fields. Generated clients must be configured to
  ignore unknown response fields; hand-written clients must do the same.
- Adding new **event types** to the SSE stream. `type` is an open set:
  clients must skip events they do not recognize.
- Adding new values to enums documented as open (`error.code`, tool
  `kind`, permission option `id`).
- Documentation and example changes bump the **patch** version.

## What requires `/v2`

- Removing or renaming an endpoint, request field, or response field.
- Changing a field's type or nullability.
- Changing the meaning of a status code on an existing endpoint.
- Removing values from any enum, or adding values to the closed enums
  (`Run.status`, `Session.behavior_mode`, `Session.permission_mode`,
  `stop_reason`, permission option `kind`).
- Changing SSE ordering or terminal-event semantics.

A `/v2` ships alongside `/v1`; `/v1` is removed no earlier than the next
major release of Draupnir after `/v2` becomes the default, and its endpoints
are marked `deprecated: true` in the contract for at least one minor
release beforehand.

## Editing rules

- The contract is hand-authored and reviewed. Client code generated from it is
  owned and versioned by the consumer.
- Every change to `src/http_api/` that alters a wire shape must update
  these files and the conformance suite in the same pull request.
- `info.version` must be bumped in the same pull request that changes the
  contract.

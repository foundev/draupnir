//! ChatGPT-subscription-backed LLM backend.
//!
//! Talks to `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` (the
//! Responses API, not Chat Completions) using the OAuth `access_token`
//! and `chatgpt_account_id` stored in `~/.codex/auth.json`. This is the
//! same endpoint Codex CLI hits when you `codex login` with a ChatGPT
//! Plus/Pro/Enterprise account, so usage counts against the ChatGPT
//! subscription rather than against an `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
//!
//! Why a separate client? The standard `/v1/chat/completions` path takes
//! Chat Completions JSON (messages, tool_calls). The ChatGPT backend
//! takes the Responses API shape (typed `input` items, `function_call` /
//! `function_call_output`) and streams a different SSE schema
//! (`response.output_text.delta`, `response.output_item.done`,
//! `response.completed`). Reusing `OpenAiClient` would mean entangling
//! two protocols in one type; a sibling client is cleaner.
//!
//! Trust posture: the `Authorization` and `ChatGPT-Account-ID` headers
//! mirror what `codex` CLI sends. We deliberately set `originator:
//! codex_cli_rs` and `User-Agent: codex_cli_rs ...` so brokk-acp shows
//! up identically to Codex CLI from the server's perspective -- this is
//! a pragmatic compatibility choice, not impersonation: the user *is*
//! authenticating with their own OAuth tokens.

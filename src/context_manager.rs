//! Full-history model-context compaction and turn-recap summarization.
//!
//! Model history is compacted cumulatively at completed tool-exchange
//! boundaries. The canonical system/project/skill prefix stays verbatim; an
//! older dynamic prefix becomes a structured `<state_snapshot>`, the recent
//! tail stays exact, and the current `update_plan` value is pinned separately.
//! The checkpoint is provider-neutral and persisted on its anchor turn, while
//! raw turns remain untouched for ACP replay, rewind, and Brokk compatibility.
//!
//! Compaction tries a native, in-conversation path first: the full native
//! message list (canonical prefix + dynamic history) plus the advertised
//! tool schemas is sent back to the model as-is, with one trailing user
//! instruction asking it to write the `<state_snapshot>` in place. This
//! preserves provider prompt-cache reuse and loses no structure, unlike
//! flattening to text. When that attempt is skipped (the input is already
//! too close to the context window to risk it), fails, or produces an
//! unusable or non-reducing snapshot, compaction falls back to rendering
//! history as plain text and summarizing it in a fresh request, splitting,
//! extracting, and folding hierarchically until the final state-snapshot
//! request fits. The same chunking machinery is retained for the
//! independent user-facing turn-recap feature.
